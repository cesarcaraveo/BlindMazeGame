# BlindMazeGame
This was a school project for my Game Development class.

Essentially, the objective of the game is to beat the different maze levels. However, you cannot see the maze walls.
You must use sound and/or sense of positioning to try and beat the level.

Power-ups along the way help make this task easier.

Good luck.
